## This is WeDonate Mobile Version !

> Lets come together to donate for a cause.
 We are trying a create a social network platform so that people willing to donate anything can get all information about events being organized by NGOs in there region/localities. They can follow, like, comment on events and share events being organized by NGOs through other social media platforms like facebook, whatsapp, twitter, etc. The users who have already subscribed to NGOs will get live feeds about the events. 

##### Installation :

First install 
```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
```

Then, to run it, cd into `WeDonateMobileApp` and run:

``` bash
$ npm install
$ ionic serve 
```

For Running in a Device

```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add ios android
$ ionic cordova run ios
$ ionic cordova run android
```



Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.
